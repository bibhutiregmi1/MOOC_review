Feedback,,,,,,
the course content contains all the required materials so we dont have to search other site for this course. anything we need is available in mooc,,,,,,
It was a great first class and new experience of mooc system.,,,,,,
"This week course is a bit lengthy but quite interesting. This is the first time that I am being  enrolled in such an interesting   way of teaching and learning practices. I have an experience of taking online sessions in Coursera  which was not interesting as this. Some Tasks are still needed to be completed but the way is learning is very interesting. The rewards system and level systems are very satisfying. 

What will it be if we could learn all our courses in ku mooc rather than kulms. This is  a way better than kulms.",,,,,,
"The contents covered, as well as the ellaborative contents on mooc was good. Overall, having good experience with HCI so far.",,,,,,
"This subject seems to be a very interesting one, looking forward to the sessions ahead.",,,,,,
"I get to be familiar with the concept of HCI. 
What is HCI and how does it impacts different sectors. 
How HCI helps in making system simple and easy to use.

I also get to interact with this online learning platform. It was fun to learn this way. Also the contents are organized nicely and was easy accessing and studying them.",,,,,,
"Online learning is quite more effective in this current situation. I feel quite easy learning through this and quite more interactive between us. We can navigate into different contents easily. The contents of week 1 is sufficient for us to understand. But I faced the problem while logging into mooc . It always asks for login, and said session expired everyone. It may be better if the session active until we logged out.",,,,,,
"The system is well designed and fun to use. I mainly face a problem in the inbuilt video player as I prefer double click for full screen rather than using the full screen button. Also the submitted answer button after the video ends was bit confusing and hard to know about its function at the first use. 

Similarly, at page: &#039;http://mooc.ku.edu.np/mod/lesson/view.php?id=225&amp;pageid=8&#039;, I faced a problem reading the text in the box and saw the scroll bar only after my struggle reading the contents so if it is places above or right below the box where users could easily see the scroll bar would be helpful.",,,,,,
acknowledged to know about usability metrics,,,,,,
"Sir,I like the content of the course very much.When i found that HCI was only being taught in KU I was very happy .I like the way you perfectly explained about the HCI in brief .Yours speaking skill was second to none .I am very happy to see you as my teacher.",,,,,,
Interesting to see various examples to explain the concepts well.,,,,,,
I feel easy to use the system ... All the things were managed properly and can be accessed easily,,,,,,
"Personally I think the contents of week 1 were very useful. The quiz, study materials and the different lecture videos were very useful for the students. I hope the upcoming week&#039;s contents are as exciting as week 1.",,,,,,
It was a new experience for us. I got to know many more things about HCI. I really like the idea of quiz and discussion forms. It will help us expand our knowledge.,,,,,,
"This is the first time I have been enrolled in such a site that uses an asynchronous mode of teaching-learning. I must admit that the content of week 1 was really very interesting and I completed the quizzes and tasks really easily. Mostly I liked the concept of using interesting videos to explain complex subject matter effortlessly. Now it is the fifth week and I still visit this site, not because of any pressure but because I enjoy it. Hats off to the MOOC team.",,,,,,
"In this resource , I have learnt what HCI is ,how it works and the concept of HCI ,which was very helpful for me to understand more about HCI.",,,,,,
Every time i open mooc i see a warning of Not secure on chrome.so I think it will be better if there is a secured connection when i open this website,,,,,,
the website is showing not secure. I think it is due to protocol. so if possible change the http to https.,,,,,,
"The contents are perfect and there needs no improvement in it ,but one thing I would like to be improved is the font and font size of the text content.",,,,,,
It was productive,,,,,,
"I faced few problems with the external links ,if they were made to open in a new tab it would have been easier to navigate.",,,,,,
"This week was a kinda a introduction to HCI where we learn about useability measures and mainly about how HCI works , where is it applied.",,,,,,
"From this week&#039;s course I have learned about basic of HCI and why we need it. HCI mainly concerns with efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction. Also HCI makes everything look attractive",,,,,,
By far the activities of week 1 helped a lot in knowing about the basic idea of why HCI is so important. It also shed light on some of the usability measures and the discipline of the HCI. The text video formats is also effective as learning only by next would be very boring. So far the experience of using Mooc is great and hope so it will be as enjoyable as it is in week 1.,,,,,,
"It was the first week that I interacted with the mooc system and I have to say that it was a pleasant experience to learn a HCI course through a nicely made and evolving interactive system such as this! Thank you for making this system, it is really beyond expectations!",,,,,,
"This week I learned about HCI in general and it&#039;s one of the main component Usability. I had a chance to know in-depth about Usability motivations, Universal usability, Usability Metrics, Usability measure, safety-critical system and more such stuff in such an interactive and entertaining manner. Learning had never been so fun. It is an addictive-like game. I am really happy to be reading this as my university course. Thank you for developing such an engaging learning style. I always come back to this course to check my progress and it feels good to get points when you have completed something. Everything is user-friendly. I will let you know if I find any problem. I really enjoyed this week&#039;s content :))",,,,,,
iT WAS GREAT EXPERIENCE,,,,,,
"I have enjoyed the first week in mooc so far. Since this is the first time I am using mooc, it took me some time to get along with the system. But in no time I found myself enjoying the course contents and the different badges definitely grabbed my interest.",,,,,,
I came to know there are about 25 questions of quiz. Attempting Quiz for 3rd time generates almost same questions which are faced earlier. I am not satisfied with this.,,,,,,
"All in all i think the course structure of the week 1 is fairly good. However, I&#039;d like to point out that some of the videos on the course have a very low sound to the point that it&#039;s almost inaudible. And I think there should be a small quiz session for every topic. May be 2-3 questions.",,,,,,
"Course is being more interesting with these contents.
Contents are really unique and awesome.
Thank you.",,,,,,
"The contents of week 1 are very thorough and they give a good introduction to the topic of Human Computer Interaction, along with establishing a strong foundation needed for deeper studies on this topic. Sometimes though, the frequent to and fro between the topics and too many links being provides felt a bit tedious to follow. Besides that the content was very good.",,,,,,
Hats off to the creators of this page.,,,,,,
"I was a little confused at first while using mooc and finding quiz and other materials, but with the constant use of this system I got used to it.",,,,,,
"As this was the first time using this platform, I found that this platform was really interesting, the gamified  Learning environment was one of the things that I found really intriguing.",,,,,,
"Enjoyed this week&#039;s course! I learned many new things: 
a) use of several multimedia, such as various links to course materials, links to several case studies and Youtube videos.
b) I also learned about importance of student collaboration and use of discussion forums.

In summary, this week was very interesting and useful for me. Thank you!",,,,,,
Learned about Good and Bad Design!,,,,,,
I am fully satisfied with this method of learning.,,,,,,
"i get knowledge about HCI and its fields , importance of HCI . The attached youtube are really helpful and other link provided for us is good.",,,,,,
There are too many contents available which leads us to be confused about which content to take in and which to not.,,,,,,
nice and helpful content,,,,,,
The class sessions were interesting. I was interactive in the class and enjoyed expressing my idea. My ideas were acknowledged by my teacher as well. I enjoyed the session of week 1.,,,,,,
It was my first experience in online learning and this mooc site seems well managed about providing required courses. Week 1 course contents are well balanced as I find myself easily going through those contents and understanding them. So far I am loving this different mode of learning and look forward to have the same experience in coming weeks.,,,,,,
"The materials provides here helps me to learn about HCI, fields of HCI, why HCI, and  usability and provides me an ideas to improve the already completed semester project with HCI. Feels happy and thankful to use this mooc system.",,,,,,
"The overall course content was good. However, in some places the sentence structure is long and complex. Shortening sentences will help in making the contents easier to follow. There are some pictures which, while informative are too small to look at properly. These points can be addressed for better course content in the upcoming weeks. 

Also, external links are opened in the same tab. Navigating back into the mooc site can be a hassle, overworking both the user and the site. Making the external links open in new tabs can help in this.",,,,,,
The contents of the first week were good. There were good introductory videos and relevant case studies to reinforce the importance of HCI.,,,,,,
I loved this week content. Its always good to go back and revise,,,,,,
Quizzes inside videos like most online learning platforms will be useful,,,,,,
"The articles and videos provided by categorizing them into sub topics made it easier to finish them in parts, as one topic took 10-20 minutes reading time and i could go to the next topic afterwards anytime without having to worry about where i left before. And I really enjoyed watching the videos as learning became easy and fun! Thank you sir for this great week!",,,,,,
I really enjoyed the first class of our session. Sir was really interactive and tried to get as much interaction from all the students.,,,,,,
Good list of reference material. Hope this continues in upcoming weeks.,,,,,,
Other features went smooth however i still got error using MOOC that i updated my profile but still there is a to-do-list  to update it.,,,,,,
This type of online learning is vastly different than the other type that we are currently involves in. The asynchronous learning mode is much more enjoyable in comparison to other online learning.,,,,,,
Very Interesting contents,,,,,,
I am bit late for this feedback but after remembering about what we studied in week one i got pretty basic idea about &quot,what is HCI?&quot, and &quot,why HCI is needed?&quot, and &quot,How can we achieve a certain goal using HCI?&quot, and I got answers to these questions from week one and i thick it is more effective to listen to your class rather than studying later.
The video contents were really helpful.,,,,,,
"The server didn&#039;t respond smoothly. As I was going through MCQ it stuck as I clicked submit. It killed about 5,6 seconds of time for the next question. Although I have no internet connectivity issue.",,,,,,
Considering this system now I felt Kathmandu university is Nepal&#039,s top university. This online learning platform is a great thing. KUDOS.,,,,,
It was very nice experiance.,,,,,,
suberb course content,,,,,,
best learning platform,,,,,,
amazing learning experience. 5 star for contents.,,,,,,
This system must be implemented on all secondary and lower secondary level.,,,,,,
"This week I got to learn a lot about usability and determination of usability requirements. The lecture by the instructor was effective and was helpful to me in order to understand the importance of HCI in the real world.

Regarding the mooc system, since this was the first time I have used such a system, I was a bit confused regarding how the completion systems work. Also the leveling systems seem new and strange to say the least, at least for an educational site, but I would say all for the better rather than the worse.

All in all I really enjoyed the experience for the week",,,,,,
During week 1 i found that the contents i viewed previously weren&#039,t available for reading later. On discussing the issue during the class i found that i was the only one facing the issue. The issue resolved after few days.,,,,,
"For Week 1, I found the content to be great. Specially for all the lectures video as well as text is available which i find to be extremely helpful. I learned about various aspects of HCI, Usabilty metrics, designs and many more in this Week 1 and i am looking forward for week 2. I found that the Week 1 course was designed for learning rather than remebering.

I hope the Week 2 contains are also as good as Week 1.
Loving this way of learning.

Ashish Pokhrel",,,,,,
examples with pictures and videos  makes the course content more interesting,,,,,,
"Really satisfied with the contents and  enjoyed the slides while preparing for quiz!!! And very easy to access files because of good formatting ,,, I feel like this badge system is also motivating for me.",,,,,,
"The topic Six Styles for Usability Requirements wasn&#039;t marked completed for me despite me, going through the pdf numerous times",,,,,,
"During the first week, it got quite confusing. Confusing in a sense, it was our first time using mooc after elf. However, mooc caught my attention at the very first sight. Week 1&#039;s contents were interesting and to be honest, I found mooc way easier to cope up with rather than elf.",,,,,,
The quiz system for self evaluation is great.,,,,,,
interesting videos and the articles cleared up my doubts !!,,,,,,
The sound panel of the videos should be available to make vol up and down as desired.,,,,,,
"I find the contents good. Also, the related videos were good but it could have been easier to understand  from the video if the captions and transcripts of the video were also played like in Coursera. Also, some of the images loaded in new windows in some contents. It would be much better if the images are loaded while going through the content.",,,,,,
The class was fantastic and the learning experience in online environment is much nicer than expected.,,,,,,
The class was really interesting as it was interactive. The examples(pictures) used to explain the content were excellent. It was the only class held that week that was not boring and I understood everything explained.,,,,,,
Very interesting and interactive contents in week 1. Got the introduction about HCI and its various aspects.,,,,,,
"I feel quite engaging with course materials available here, the video lectures of different people are quite helpful.",,,,,,
We were in the starting week of our course. Overall our teacher introduced us to the subject Human Computer Interaction very effectively.,,,,,,
The examples of flights and how design flaws were also responsible for disasters really motivated me to learn HCI as well as they are really interesting,,,,,,
"Week 1 of HCI, it feels like wow we get to read a subject like this. Moreover what I loved about the course was the way we are encouraged to interact in classroom and it binds our attentions in the class. The way the best resources from around the web have been researched and collected in the system is very nice.

Now about the Week 1, it somehow helped me to see things from different perspectives, see products from eyes of users. 

I personally felt like had we been taught this subject before, like in previous year or so, how much awesome we would have made our semester projects.",,,,,,
It was very well made and thought of. The link and the topics that were added for further reference were really interesting and helpful for furthering understanding the concept.,,,,,,
"The beginning lecture was very unique and interesting in my view, because until this subject there were few or no lecturer who used such amount of images and visuals to explain the topic.",,,,,,
"It was a different experience to indulge in this system and learn a new feature, however, if feasible, we can have an android version of this system",,,,,,
It was fun experience learning from these activities.,,,,,,
This week covered interesting areas of HCI and many interesting real life cases of how poor HCI can result in bad situation. Boeing 737 Max case was a very interesting read and an important one as well. More of these activities are would be great to read in future week activities,,,,,,
"First I would like to share about the thing I liked in this week. Most of the written articles were concise and fun to read. I also enjoyed the gamification of the reading process. The Wikipedia page on the three mile incident was an extremely fun read.
As for the thing that I didn&#039;t like on this week is mostly the videos. I found most of them to be somewhat boring.",,,,,,
I liked the way things were organized and the videos were interesting. Fonts were good enough for me although i wish the text was a little larger.,,,,,,
its was nice to experience online platform,,,,,,
MOOC system was not so easy to use. Had difficulty while navigating across the topics.,,,,,,
It was good. I liked it.,,,,,,
good,,,,,,
"The concept of grading, levels and batches motivated me to explore the course more and once I started exploring I couldn&#039;t stop before exploring all the materials provided.",,,,,,
"I liked the content. It is easy to find and informative as well. Since the content are not directly given, I get to explore more about the subject and get to learn more as well.",,,,,,
The week 1 over all was a new experience in terms of learning and exploring study materials. It was intuitive and interactive.,,,,,,
"This course plan has implanted some basic knowledge about the HCI(hunman computer interaction) and also showed hpw it is helpful to create a more convinent and comfortable enviroment to interact the computer.We also learnt that it also help the differently able people in many other ways .
This journey of learning is very effective and fun.",,,,,,
"Before this, I thought designs only meant pleasing visuals &amp; animations and not much about usability. I did not think bad design could cause such disasters which signify importance of good design much more.",,,,,,
The week have an insight on the use of HCI in various fields. It was particularly helpful in learning the usability and universality of design.,,,,,,
"Home&gt; Computer Science&gt;COMP 341&gt;WEEK 1: ACTIVITIES&gt;What is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
On this breadcrumbs menu, we are able to return to respective previous pages except &quot;WEEK 1: ACTIVITIES&quot; by tapping on each menu item. I think it would be better if we able to return to &quot;WEEK 1: ACTIVITIES&quot; as well. We are forced to tap on back button from the respective browser or  tap on COMP 341 tap to go back.",,,,,,
"Course seems really effective, especially due to teaching methodology like videos and articles.",,,,,,
"The Contents are very unique and interesting. Learning by seeing is always helpful than just learning the concepts.  By seeing this, how this is useful in real life, I got to know about the many Concepts of design principles and HCI.",,,,,,
the week activities can further be more categorised so that users can know what it is. The opening of a link in the same tab is very very annoying like we should keep on clicking back if we have a stack of pages.,,,,,,
